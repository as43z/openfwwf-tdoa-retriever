# OpenFWWF retriever kernel module

This repository aims to develop a custom kernel module that retrieves data from the openfwwf firmware. This module is developed in parallel with my version of the OpenFWWF: [custom-openfwwf-tdoa](https://github.com/as43z/custom-openfwwf-tdoa).

What follows is an identical description of the README from the other repository.

## Motivations

New technologies evolve at a very fast pace; introducing newer challenges to the already chaotic ecosystem. Nowadays, IoT and other high-density networks are the focus of the challenges we are facing. In a broad manner, we can define the landscape as precise location demanding (IoT devices, medical use, ...) but no advances on this challenge have arrived. Therefore, we aim to implement a firmware solution for COTS devices.

## Algorithm

There is an algorithm developed by Israel Martin and Enrica Zola which propose the addition of a passive-TDOA, listening to packages in a promiscuous mode; calculating the time difference of arrival, enabling the computation of a highly precise measurment of the distance to a reference point.

## Contact Point

Please, if you have any suggestion or have something to resolve. Refer to me @ [albert.saez.nunez@estudiantat.upc.edu](mailto://albert.saez.nunez@estudiantat.upc.edu).

Be mindful I have many more projects/work going on, patiente is key.
